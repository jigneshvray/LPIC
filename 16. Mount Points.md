A mount point is a directory where an external partition, storage device, or file system can become accessible to the user or application requiring it (e.g., when a Linux installation process requires access to the USB device containing the ISO image or installation files).

Mounting means attaching a partition, hard disk, or file system to the system in use. Similarly, when we insert a CD in Windows operating systems, the default mount point would be _D_:/ or _Cdrom_, the “directory” where files become accessible to the user. Of course, this is different than in Linux because in Linux mount points are regular directories, like any other directory.

Normally, the default mount points in Linux are /_media_, /_mnt_, /_usb_ and /_media/mnt_, but users can mount devices in any directory.

Let’s suppose my computer has only one hard drive, in this case, an SSD hard disk.

The first hard disk, if SSD, by default will be named as _/dev/sda_, if the hard disk has two partitions, the first will be _/dev/sda1_, and the second partition will be _/dev/sda2_. If there is another partition, it will be _/dev/sda3_, etc.

If I attach a second storage hardware device, it will be named as /dev/sdb. The first partition will be /dev/sdb1, the second _/dev/sdb2_, etc.
