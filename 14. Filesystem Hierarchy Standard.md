**1. / (Root):** Primary hierarchy root and root directory of the entire file system hierarchy.

-   Every single file and directory starts from the root directory
-   The only root user has the right to write under this directory
-   /root is the root user’s home directory, which is not the same as /


**2. /bin :** Essential command binaries that need to be available in single-user mode; for all users, e.g., cat, ls, cp.   
 
-   Contains binary executables
-   Common linux commands you need to use in single-user modes are located under this directory.
-   Commands used by all the users of the system are located here e.g. ps, ls, ping, grep, cp

**3. /boot :** Boot loader files, e.g., kernels, initrd.   
 
-   Kernel initrd, vmlinux, grub files are located under /boot
-   Example: initrd.img-2.6.32-24-generic, vmlinuz-2.6.32-24-generic

**4. /dev :** Essential device files, e.g., /dev/null.   
 
-   These include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system.
-   Example: /dev/tty1, /dev/usbmon0

**5. /etc :** Host-specific system-wide configuration files.

-   Contains configuration files required by all programs.
-   This also contains startup and shutdown shell scripts used to start/stop individual programs.
-   Example: /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/logrotate.conf.

**6. /home :** Users’ home directories, containing saved files, personal settings, etc.

-   Home directories for all users to store their personal files.
-   example: /home/kishlay, /home/kv

**7. /lib :** Libraries essential for the binaries in /bin/ and /sbin/.

-   Library filenames are either ld* or lib*.so.*
-   Example: ld-2.11.1.so, libncurses.so.5.7

**8. /media :** Mount points for removable media such as CD-ROMs (appeared in FHS-2.3).

-   Temporary mount directory for removable devices.
-   Examples, /media/cdrom for CD-ROM; /media/floppy for floppy drives; /media/cdrecorder for CD writer

**9. /mnt :** Temporarily mounted filesystems.

-   Temporary mount directory where sysadmins can mount filesystems.

**10. /opt :** Optional application software packages.

-   Contains add-on applications from individual vendors.
-   Add-on applications should be installed under either /opt/ or /opt/ sub-directory.

**11. /sbin :** Essential system binaries, e.g., fsck, init, route.

-   Just like /bin, /sbin also contains binary executables.
-   The linux commands located under this directory are used typically by system administrator, for system maintenance purpose.
-   Example: iptables, reboot, fdisk, ifconfig, swapon

**12. /srv :** Site-specific data served by this system, such as data and scripts for web servers, data offered by FTP servers, and repositories for version control systems.

-   srv stands for service.
-   Contains server specific services related data.
-   Example, /srv/cvs contains CVS related data.

**13. /tmp :** Temporary files. Often not preserved between system reboots, and may be severely size restricted.

-   Directory that contains temporary files created by system and users.
-   Files under this directory are deleted when system is rebooted.

**14. /usr :** Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data; contains the majority of (multi-)user utilities and applications.   
 
-   Contains binaries, libraries, documentation, and source-code for second level programs.
-   /usr/bin contains binary files for user programs. If you can’t find a user binary under /bin, look under /usr/bin. For example: at, awk, cc, less, scp
-   /usr/sbin contains binary files for system administrators. If you can’t find a system binary under /sbin, look under /usr/sbin. For example: atd, cron, sshd, useradd, userdel
-   /usr/lib contains libraries for /usr/bin and /usr/sbin
-   /usr/local contains users programs that you install from source. For example, when you install apache from source, it goes under /usr/local/apache2
-   /usr/src holds the Linux kernel sources, header-files and documentation.

**15. /proc :** Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information as files. In Linux, corresponds to a procfs mount. Generally automatically generated and populated by the system, on the fly.

-   Contains information about system process.
-   This is a pseudo filesystem contains information about running process. For example: /proc/{pid} directory contains information about the process with that particular pid.
-   This is a virtual filesystem with text information about system resources. For example: /proc/uptime
