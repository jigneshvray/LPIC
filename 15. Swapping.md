Swap is a space on a disk that is used when the amount of physical RAM memory is full. When a Linux system runs out of RAM, inactive pages are moved from the RAM to the swap space.

Swap space can take the form of either a dedicated swap partition or a swap file. In most cases, when running Linux on a virtual machine, a swap partition is not present, so the only option is to create a swap file.

    The second type of memory in modern Linux systems is swap space. The primary function of swap space is to substitute disk space for RAM memory when real RAM fills up and more space is needed.

How to add Swap File? Create a file that will be used for swap:

$ sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile

Only the root user should be able to write and read the swap file. To set the correct permissions type:

$ sudo chmod 600 /swapfile

Use the mkswap utility to set up the file as Linux swap area:

$ sudo mkswap /swapfile

To verify that the swap is active, use either the swapon or the free command as shown below:

$ sudo swapon --show

First, deactivate the swap by typing:

$ sudo swapoff -v /swapfile

Turn off the swap partition with the command which turns off all swap space:

$ swapoff -a

Now display the existing partitions on the hard drive.

$ $ fdisk -l

Remove the swap file entry /swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0 from the /etc/fstab file.

Finally, delete the actual swapfile file using the rm command:

$ sudo rm /swapfile

To view all devices marked as swap in the /etc/fstab file you can use the --all option. Though devices that are already working as swap space are skipped.

$ swapon --all

Disable swap

$ sudo swapoff -a

$ sudo sed -i '/ swap / s/^/#/' /etc/fstab

If you want to view a summary of swap space usage by device, use the --summary option as follows.

$ swapon --summary

The free command is used to display the amount of free and used system memory. Using the free command with -h option, which displays output in a human readable format.

$ free -h
