The basic steps for adding a new logical volume are as follows.

1.  If necessary, install a new hard drive.
2.  Optional: Create a partition on the hard drive.
3.  Create a physical volume (PV) of the complete hard drive or a partition on the hard drive.
4.  Assign the new physical volume to an existing volume group (VG) or create a new volume group.
5.  Create a new logical volumes (LV) from the space in the volume group.
6.  Create a filesystem on the new logical volume.
7.  Add appropriate entries to /etc/fstab for mounting the filesystem.
8.  Mount the filesystem.
